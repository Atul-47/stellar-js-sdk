# Stellar Lumens JavaScript SDK
Playing with Stellar JavaScript SDK - Stellar Lumens: ES7 async/await example.
This example creates two accounts on the testnet and let's the friendbot give them testnet tokens.
Next, we transfer a small amount from one account to another.

## Installation
Execute in terminal inside the root of the project:
`yarn install`
`npm install`

## Start & Usage
Again in terminal at root:
`npm start`

Surf with your web browser to `http://localhost:4000/` to create the accounts.
Next, let's tranfer money from `accountA` to `accountB` by visiting `http://localhost:4000/payment`.
Watch your terminal to see what's happening.

If problems, create issue on this repo. Thanks! :)
